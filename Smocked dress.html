        After studying Fashion Design Ciara went on to work as a freelance designer fabricating fashion
        and costume garments and collaborating with models, photographers, hair stylists and make-up artists.

        This dress was created using many different types of smocking where the material is stitched at
        specific points to create three dimensional shapes such as flowers or basket weave (Lattice Smocking).
        A headpiece was created to match using bent wire to form the shape and beads adhered
        to the wire for decoration. A large smocked train is also attached for dramatic affect.
